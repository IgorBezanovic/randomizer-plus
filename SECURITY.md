## Responsible disclosure security policy

Enacting a responsible disclosure policy stands as a cornerstone in safeguarding the interests of our esteemed project users, shielding them from potential security vulnerabilities that may surface publicly without an adequate remedy. This approach entails a meticulous private assessment of vulnerabilities, followed by a judicious disclosure only after a prudent timeframe that allows for the mitigation of risks and ensures a smooth transition for our users.
Should you opt to communicate directly with us via email, be assured of our unwavering commitment to swiftly address any concerns raised. Similarly, when engaging with a security program, their disclosure policy will delineate the timeframe and procedures involved, underscoring our collective commitment to transparency and accountability.
We earnestly implore you to abstain from any malicious actions that could imperil the safety and integrity of our valued users, the project itself, or any esteemed member of our project team. Such a collective effort ensures that we uphold the highest standards of security and trust within our community.

## Reporting a security issue
We consider the security of our systems a top priority. But no matter how much effort we put into system security, there can still be vulnerabilities present.
